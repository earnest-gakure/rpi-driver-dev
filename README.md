# Linux Device Driver Development on Raspberry Pi 5
## Overview

This repository documents my study and practical implementation of Linux kernel and device driver development using the Raspberry Pi 5 platform.The work follows the structured approach presented in:

#### Linux Driver Development with Raspberry Pi® Practical Labs - https://github.com/ALIBERA/linux_raspberrypi_book
#### Author: Alberto Liberal
The book provides foundational and advanced knowledge on Linux kernel architecture, kernel modules, and device driver development. This repository contains my practical exercises, kernel builds, and experimental implementations based on the concepts covered in the text.
## Hardware Platform
All experiments and kernel builds are performed on:
### Raspberry Pi 5 (ARM64 Architecture)
The Raspberry Pi 5 serves as the target embedded platform for compiling, configuring, booting, and testing custom Linux kernels and device drivers.
## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To understand the internal structure and architecture of the Linux kernel.
- To build and boot a custom Linux kernel on Raspberry Pi 5.
- To develop and test loadable kernel modules.
- To implement and analyze basic Linux device drivers.
- To gain practical experience in low-level systems programming on ARM-based embedded hardware.
